Why are the balls so big?   the blob balls

Do you add the spinny line to make it harder?

What's the red box for?

Do I have the high score?


observations:

Multiple blobs and longer blobs make it harder
when you are learning to play.

Balls kept getting stuck in the mass of the blob and shooting off the screen.


Having a goal at the top was really hard until he played
for several minutes.
